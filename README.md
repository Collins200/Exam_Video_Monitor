# Exam_Video_Monitor  
Probelm:  
There is a problem in the exam more so in remote area online lerning where students hire other people to do for them the exams.Due to this we get incorrect information as a result of the results coming from unintended person.  <br>
Solution:  
I have designed an online video monitor where when one starts exam the video starts recording.The examiner will pass in a place whe he or she intends to get the video of the recorded student doing exam.  
The teacher will as welll get the exam answers beside the video.
